Hooray! Fancy Tiger Crafts has just released my fourth published knitting pattern, the Florence Shawl! This shawl is named after my grandmother Florence Salzmann. Here my sister Amber is modeling the pattern in Fancy Tiger Craft's Heirloom Romney yarn in colorways Nettles and Fava Bean. Fancy Tiger just released [a blog post about this new pattern](http://www.fancytiger.blogspot.com/2014/04/meet-florence-buckhorn-our-two-newest.html) and Amber's new hat pattern the Buckhorn.

The Florence Shawl pattern is started from the center out, so can easily work with any yarn, needle and gauge that results in a drapey flowing fabric. Feel free to substitute any yarn in your stash with slightly larger than normal needles and just keep knitting until you like the size. Remember that blocking will increase the finished size of your project!

You can buy this pattern on [Ravelry](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/florence-shawl) or on [Etsy](http://www.etsy.com/shop/fancytiger). If you would like a hard copy, feel free to contact [Fancy Tiger Crafts](http://fancytiger.com/craftindex.html), or stop by their store in Denver!
