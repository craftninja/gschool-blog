Have you seen the new X-Men movie, Days of Future Past? So much fun. But when I saw Wolverine's shirt from the past, I was truly star-struck. Wha-what? Liberty of London shirt? Swoon!

Libery of London opened in 1875 and quickly became very well known for their Tana Lawn, a 100% cotton lightweight fabric with an very high thread count. The fabric is so drapy and smooth I have often been asked if it is silk. The fabric has seasonal prints, and often classic prints come back into production. The lovely shirt worn by Hugh Jackman as Wolverine looks to me like the Libery Ceasar.

Beautiful! I'm not sure that colorway of Wolverine's is currently in production, but if you want to make a gorgeous shirt, I do have some other Liberty Tana Lawn suggestions...

As for a pattern, may I suggest the Collette Negroni. This pattern is fully finished and beautiful! It is super easy to alter and the directions walk you through all sorts of more advanced techniques. I learned a lot making these shirts. Included is the short and long sleeve versions, and putting snaps on instead of buttons is super easy with the Snap Setter! If you are looking for a more feminine cut, try (Cal Patch's Button Down Shirt from Design it Yourself Clothes)[https://blog.etsy.com/en/2009/how-tuesday-button-down-shirt-from-design-it-yourself-clothe/].

Oh and then of course there is Magneto's shirt. That fabric looks sooooo familiar... oh yeah!
